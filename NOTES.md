### SplitIterable NOTES:

Run XahTest. The route itself is one line. Bafflingly simple.

### Funny Story

The first time I had to split a list of objects, I looked for a long time in all 167 examples of .split( that I could find in camel-core. I was looking for an argument to use with split( that would tell it what to expect. But when I finally found it I wouldn't believe it and just kept looking.

When a body is an iterable, all you need is split().body(). Too simple for me to believe.
